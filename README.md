🥐 About the Project

Cuupin Backend is a backend system built with Laravel, developed to support a bakery flash-sale and pre-order platform where users can reserve limited bakery items during specific time slots.
This API powers core features such as product management, dynamic discount sessions, user authentication, and order handling — enabling both bakeries and customers to interact efficiently in real time.

The backend ensures smooth operations through secure payment integration, transaction validation, and role-based access control for both bakeries and customers.
It’s designed with scalability in mind, providing endpoints optimized for mobile and web clients to handle high-traffic booking periods without performance issues.

🎯 Goals

Cuupin Backend was created to help bakeries reduce product waste and improve sales efficiency by introducing a time-limited reservation system that rewards early and loyal customers.
The platform aims to connect bakeries with customers through technology that feels simple, fast, and rewarding.
